# Introduction

This is a current homepage and information hub owned by Junior Coding Team members. Here you can find information around participating in upcoming challenges and projects within our junior coding group. Includes ticketing &amp; planning tools, important links and a set of rules required for a successful merge of your PR.

## TECHNOLOGY AND LANGUAGES USED

At the moment the idea is to use your regular HTML/CSS/JS and build up education and enviromental resources with a purpose of solving problems using basic technologies.

#### Experience level:

- Begginer/Trainee/Junior

#### Skills we're looking for:

- UI / UX / Front End / Design / Research / Socials / Planing & Organising Skills /

## Main place we use to chat and vote:

Our main communication tool is WONDR platform. This is where we keep all our documents and important information, meeting summaries, tutorials and guides. WONDR Messenger is what we use to chat, ask questions and keep up with other team members. You can use it in the browser or you can download an app to your phone. You can join us by visiting this invite link here: https://mywondr.co/profile/view/cdd60d10-7ac3-11eb-b163-1fd52740df0d/?invite=1

In the past we used to use discord as our main communication tool but since our switch to WONDR weâ€™ve removed duplicated channels and only use Discord for audio/video/screen sharing meetings. One of those is our Friday Focus Session which happens every Friday at 7PM UK time and is advertised on WONDR as an event - which you can save to your calendars. You can join us by visiting this invite link here: https://discord.com/invite/HgFaYYADRC

## Current Project - TBD

We're running a vote on the first project we'll be starting to work on as a team. To cast your vote and participate in the said challenge/project please join our discord channel using the link above. We will be using HTML/CSS/JS with an additon of Bootstrap/Tailwind/Other if voted on.
